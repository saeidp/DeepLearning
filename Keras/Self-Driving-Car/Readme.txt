Uses tem1 version 1 windows 64
1- install the above package
2- run it then after being comfortable on how you can drive the car 
3- record and assign the subfolder of your model folder (ie: data) (go 3 laps forward and 3 laps backward)
5- after finishing with recording a folder will be added to your data: IMG folder and driving_log.csv.
6- images have 3 of them left, right and center.
7- create a git repository called track from you data subfolder and push it to your github. You need this during training your model from Colabreading


For running the simulator in actula mode and using your model parameters applied to the images coming from simulator you need to create a socket application
